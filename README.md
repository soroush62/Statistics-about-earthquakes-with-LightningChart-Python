## Loading and Processing Data

### How to Load the Data Files

Loading and processing seismic data involves several steps. The dataset used in this project is obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which captures comprehensive data on earthquake magnitudes and locations across the United States and its surrounding areas.
```python
import pandas as pd

file_path = 'usgs_main.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
```

### Handling and Preprocessing the Data

The earthquake dataset is first loaded using Pandas, and the 'time' column is converted to datetime format. Missing values in critical columns are handled to maintain data integrity. For time-series analysis, the data is resampled by month, and categorical data is aggregated to provide proportions for visualizations. Latitude and longitude data are used to interpolate magnitudes for creating grids and 3D surface plots.

```python
# Convert 'time' column to datetime
data['time'] = pd.to_datetime(data['time'])

# Handle missing values (example: filling NaN in 'mag' column with the mean)
data['mag'].fillna(data['mag'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Resample data by month for time-series analysis
monthly_data = data.set_index('time').resample('M').size()

# Aggregate categorical data for proportions
type_counts = data['type'].value_counts()

# Prepare data for heatmap and 3D surface plot
latitudes = data['latitude'].values
longitudes = data['longitude'].values
magnitudes = data['mag'].values

# Create grid data for the surface plot
grid_lat, grid_lon = np.meshgrid(
    np.linspace(latitudes.min(), latitudes.max(), 100),
    np.linspace(longitudes.min(), longitudes.max(), 100))

# Perform interpolation
grid_mag = griddata((latitudes, longitudes), magnitudes,(grid_lat, grid_lon), method='linear')

# Fill NaN values with the mean of the magnitudes
nan_mask = np.isnan(grid_mag)
grid_mag[nan_mask] = np.nanmean(magnitudes)
```

## Visualizing Data with LightningChart

### Introduction to LightningChart for Python

LightningChart for Python provides various interactive and high-performance chart types suitable for data analysis and visualization. It allows you to create detailed and informative dashboards to monitor and analyze seismic data.

### Creating the Charts

Here are brief example scripts and diagrams of various charts utilized in this project:

#### Line Chart: Number of Earthquakes Over Time

This line chart illustrates the monthly frequency of earthquakes over the year 2022. The x-axis represents time, with each tick mark indicating the start of a month, and the y-axis shows the number of earthquakes.

```python
import pandas as pd
import lightningchart as lc
from datetime import datetime

lc.set_license('my-license-key')

file_path = 'usgs_main.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

data['time'] = pd.to_datetime(data['time'])
monthly_data = data.set_index('time').resample('M').size()

x_values = [datetime.timestamp(d) * 1000 for d in monthly_data.index]
y_values = monthly_data.values.tolist()

chart = lc.ChartXY(theme=lc.Themes.White, title='Number of Earthquakes Over Time')
line_series = chart.add_line_series()
line_series.append_samples(x_values=x_values, y_values=y_values)
chart.open()
```
![](Images/Number-of-Earthquakes-Over-Time.png)

The chart shows fluctuations in the number of earthquakes each month. There are notable peaks and declines, with a significant drop in December. This trend analysis helps identify periods of increased seismic activity, which could be crucial for earthquake preparedness and risk management.

#### Pie Chart: Proportion of Earthquake Types

This pie chart displays the proportions of different types of seismic events recorded. The chart segments show the count of standard earthquakes, explosions, and chemical explosions.

```python
import pandas as pd
import lightningchart as lc

lc.set_license('my-license-key')

file_path = 'usgs_main.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

mag_type_counts = data['type'].value_counts()
slices_data = [{'name': mag_type, 'value': count} for mag_type, count in mag_type_counts.items()]

chart = lc.PieChart(labels_inside_slices=False, title='Proportion of Earthquake Types', theme=lc.Themes.White)
chart.add_slices(slices_data)
chart.set_inner_radius(50)
chart.open()
```
![Seabed](Images/Proportion-of-Earthquake-Types.png)

The visualization reveals that the vast majority of recorded events are standard earthquakes (blue), with a small fraction being explosions (green) and chemical explosions (red). This information helps in understanding the predominant types of seismic activities in the dataset.

#### Scatter Chart: Magnitude vs. Depth

The scatter plot shows the relationship between earthquake magnitude and depth. The x-axis represents the depth (km), and the y-axis represents the magnitude of the earthquakes. The color gradient from blue to orange indicates increasing magnitude.

```python
import pandas as pd
import lightningchart as lc

lc.set_license('my-license-key')

file_path = 'usgs_main.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

x_values = data['depth'].values.tolist()
y_values = data['mag'].values.tolist()

chart = lc.ScatterChart(theme=lc.Themes.White, title='Magnitude vs. Depth')
series = chart.series.append_samples(x_values=x_values, y_values=y_values)
chart.open()
```
![Seabed](Images/Magnitude-vs-Depth.png)

This plot demonstrates that higher magnitude earthquakes occur at various depths, although there are more frequent lower magnitude earthquakes at shallower depths. It also shows some clustering of higher magnitude earthquakes at specific depths. This analysis can provide insights into the depth-related behavior of seismic activities.

#### Heatmap: Earthquake Magnitudes by Latitude and Longitude

The heatmap visualizes the magnitudes of earthquakes across different geographic coordinates. The x-axis represents longitude, and the y-axis represents latitude. The color intensity represents the magnitude of the earthquakes.

```python
import pandas as pd
import lightningchart as lc
import numpy as np

lc.set_license('my-license-key')

file_path = 'usgs_main.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

latitudes = np.linspace(data['latitude'].min(), data['latitude'].max(), 100)
longitudes = np.linspace(data['longitude'].min(), data['longitude'].max(), 100)
lat_grid, lon_grid = np.meshgrid(latitudes, longitudes)

mag_grid = np.zeros_like(lat_grid)
for i in range(lat_grid.shape[0]):
    for j in range(lon_grid.shape[1]):
        distances = np.sqrt((data['latitude'] - lat_grid[i, j])**2 + (data['longitude'] - lon_grid[i, j])**2)
        closest_index = distances.idxmin()
        mag_grid[i, j] = data.loc[closest_index, 'mag']

chart = lc.ChartXY(title="Heatmap of Earthquake Magnitudes by Latitude and Longitude", theme=lc.Themes.White)
heatmap_series = chart.add_heatmap_grid_series(columns=len(longitudes), rows=len(latitudes))
heatmap_series.invalidate_intensity_values(mag_grid)
heatmap_series.set_start(x=data['longitude'].min(), y=data['latitude'].min())
heatmap_series.set_end(x=data['longitude'].max(), y=data['latitude'].max())
chart.open()
```
![Seabed](Images/Heatmap-of-Earthquake-Magnitudes-by-Latitude-and-Longitude.png)

The heatmap identifies areas with higher and lower seismic activities. Regions with high-intensity colors indicate higher magnitude earthquakes, while areas with cooler colors show lower magnitude events. This spatial distribution analysis helps in pinpointing seismic hotspots and regions that might require closer monitoring.

#### 3D Surface Plot: Earthquake Magnitudes

This 3D surface plot represents earthquake magnitudes across different geographic coordinates. The axes represent latitude, longitude, and magnitude.

```python
import pandas as pd
import lightningchart as lc
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import griddata

lc.set_license('my-license-key')

file_path = 'usgs_main.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

latitudes = data['latitude'].values
longitudes = data['longitude'].values
magnitudes = data['mag'].values

grid_lat, grid_lon = np.meshgrid(
    np.linspace(latitudes.min(), latitudes.max(), 100),
    np.linspace(longitudes.min(), longitudes.max(), 100)
)

grid_mag = griddata((latitudes, longitudes), magnitudes, (grid_lat, grid_lon), method='linear')
grid_mag[np.isnan(grid_mag)] = np.nanmean(magnitudes)

chart = lc.Chart3D(theme=lc.Themes.White, title='3D Surface of Earthquake Magnitudes')
surface_series = chart.add_surface_grid_series(columns=grid_mag.shape[1], rows=grid_mag.shape[0])
surface_series.set_start(x=longitudes.min(), z=latitudes.min())
surface_series.set_end(x=longitudes.max(), z=latitudes.max())
surface_series.invalidate_height_map(grid_mag.tolist())
chart.open()
```
![Seabed](Images/Recording.gif)

The 3D surface plot offers a comprehensive view of how earthquake magnitudes are distributed spatially. Peaks in the plot indicate areas with higher magnitudes, while valleys represent regions with lower magnitudes. This visualization is particularly useful for understanding the topographical variation of seismic activity, aiding in more detailed geospatial analysis.
